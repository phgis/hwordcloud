## Introduction

The [htmlwidgets](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets) package is very interesting and powerful. All the time, I want write my own html widgets, but I failed. This is my third try, finally I success! and the `hwordcloud` package come out. As I first try using `htmlwidgets`, I hope you will tolerate some of the flaws of this R package, and I will improve it in the future. Next, let's use `hwordcloud`!
